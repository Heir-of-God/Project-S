# About repository ✨

Hello👋 and welcome to my competitive programming related repository "Project S"! Here I will post my solutions for various programming problems🧩 in a structured manner, which are presented on various services such as Leetcode, Hackerrank, Codeforces, Codingame, Codewars and others.

My solutions may be ineffective, complex or confusing, since I, like many others, are constantly learning, including how to effectively solve hard programming problems💫. Most of my solutions will be presented in Python, since this is the language I know best, but C or JavaScript may appear here and there😊.

I will be grateful🍀 if you give my repository a "⭐" if you find it interesting or useful. More detailed information on each section can be found below. Happy coding💻!

## Leetcode 🎩

Here you can find solutions for these types of problems: Dailys📆, Contests🏆 (those that I managed to solve), Study plans📃 (such as the top 150 interviews) and just problems that I solved out of boredom (Others)😴.  

My Leetcode account: [link](https://leetcode.com/heir-of-god/)  
The Leetcode solutions folder is structured📋 somehow like this:

```
├── Dailys📁
│   └── <date in "DD.MM.YYYY" format>.py📜
├── Contests📁
│   └── <"Weekly/Biweekly" "contest's number">📁
│       └── <"problem's number">.py📜
├── Study plans📁
│   └── <"plan's name">📁
│       └── <"problem's number">.py📜
└── Others📁
    └── <"problem's number on Leetcode">.py📜
```

P.S. The file for one solution may contain several "Solution" classes (several methods have been found) or a re-solution if, for example, the daily task has already been encountered before📆.

## HackerRank 🔋

Here you can find solutions for these types of problems: Preparation kits💼, Topics🔎 (algorithms, DS, math etc.) and Contests🏆 (though I don't know when they'll appear there due to the fact that contests are rare on this platform).

The HackerRank solutions folder is structured📋 somehow like this:

```
├── PreparationKits📁
│   └── <"kit's name">📁
│       └── Week<"week's number">📁
│           └── <"problem's number"> <"problem's name">.py📜
├── Topics📁
│   └── <"topic's name">📁
│       └── <"problem's name">.py📜
└── Contests📁
    └── <"contest's name">📁
        └── <"problem's number"> <"problem's name">.py📜
```

## Codeforces 🏆

Here you can find solutions for these types of problems: Problemsets📚 (lists of problems I found somewhere), Others📖 (just problems from the "problemset" page) and Сontests🏆 (with problems that I managed to solve).

My Codeforces account: [link](https://codeforces.com/profile/Heir-of-God)  
The Codeforces solutions folder is structured📋 somehow like this:
```
├── Contests📁
│   └── <"contest's name">📁
│       └── <"problem's # in this contest">.py📜 
├── Problemsets📁
│   └── <"problemset name">📁
│       └── link.txt📜         | (contains link to the place where I've found this list of problems)
│       └── <"problem's identifier on Codeforces"> <"problem's name">.py📜
└── Others📁
    └── <"problem's identifier on Codeforces"> <"problem's name">.py📜
```
